For anyone else still struggling with this here's the steps to install make in cygwin :
    Run the cygwin installer from the downloads.
    After choosing the mirror you are shown the packages you can install.
    choose the Devel package (click on it it will turn from "Default" to "Install".
    when the installation is finish run the cmd and command "bash" and check if make installed run "make -v". And you are done.
hope it's helpful.

You have two options:
    Use Cygwin (Unix emulation library).
    Port to Winsock (Windows standard library).
The first option allows you to compile your Unix sources mostly untouched, but ties you to the Cygwin emulation library (which implies two things at runtime: general performance -no only network- will probably be less than optimal; and the running environment must have the Cygwin DLL available). The second alternative requires you to replace sys/socket.h (BSD sockets library, UNIX standard for the TCP/IP stack) with winsock2.h, and rewrite some parts of the code -not much, but some.
