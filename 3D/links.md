This a HCSR04 ultrasounds sensor holder for use with the escornabot robot that you can found in the http://escornabot.com/ web page. 
It has an 1,5 mm hole in the support base so you can screw it in the base of the escornabot.

I designed a LED-Ring-Holder for my ANET A8. It is mounted via the single screw which fixes the extruder to the extruder-slide thing (no idea how it is called).

It is for 60mm 12V LED-Rings like this one:

I've designed two versions, one for a ring width of 5mm (i've printed a previous version of this one for me) and one with 8mm width.

If the ring does not fit in the holder, try to sand the three noses/hooks a bit.

Note: You have to remove the termistor to install the holder & LED-Ring.
