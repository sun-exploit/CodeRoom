#### Sysdig + VMware Tanzu

 - [Secure Tanzu Service Mesh](https://sysdig.com/blog/secure-tanzu-service-mesh/)

In mid-March, Sysdig announced support for VMWare Tanzu Service Mesh, which is built on VMware NSX. One of the key capabilities of Tanzu Service Mesh is the ability to enable service owners, operators and DevSecOps teams the ability to apply operational controls across services to help secure communications between microservices, data and users across multiple cloud-native platforms. The integration of Sysdig Secure with Tanzu Service Mesh is targeted at extending the depth of security intelligence available for Tanzu Service Mesh users with critical findings that help drive better policy decisions.

#### Prometheus Catalog

 - [PromCat](http://www.promcat.io/)

In late March, Sysdig announced the Prometheus Catalog (PromCat), a curated (by Sysdig) repository of Prometheus exporters, dashboards and alerts to monitor any infrastructure, application and service running in the cloud. Sysdig offers documentation, suggested configurations and Sysdig customer support. There are hundreds of open source Prometheus exporters at all levels of completion. Having validated integrations — exporters, dashboards and alerts — with documentation, helps customers to decide which integration to use, how to configure them and keep up with changes. DevOps teams can save weeks of time per integration by reducing this research. PromCat launched with integrations for Kubernetes control plane, Istio and several AWS services.
