NOTES

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.70 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.70 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.67 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.67 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.65 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.65 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.63 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.63 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.62 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.62 for security improvement.

- Because new Media Card Reader deivce is supported from UEFI BIOS version 2.57,
  UEFI BIOS on the system with the new Media Card Reader device is not able to
  downgrade to version 2.56 or older.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.56 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.56 for degrading security function.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.50 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 2.50 because the new 10-digit part
  number and serial number format was once installed. The old UEFI BIOS with the
  7-digit part number and serial number format can not handle the 10-digit
  format.

- Due to Security improvement, once updating UEFI BIOS to the version 2.06
  (G2ET86WW), it is prevented to update UEFI BIOS to 2.05 or older version.

- Be aware that the OS Optimized Defaults option in the Restart menu of ThinkPad
  Setup should not be normally changed. Lenovo recommends to use the factory
  default setting for it, as follows.

                                                       OS Optimized Defaults
  - For Windows 10/8.1/8 64-bit Preload models         [Enabled]
  - For Windows 8.1/8 32-bit, Windows 7, Windows XP    [Disabled]

  To install Windows 8.1/8 32-bit, Windows 7 or Windows XP, the OS Optimized
  Defaults option should be [Disabled].

  If the OS Optimized Defaults setting is changed, Setup Default by the F9 key
  will not load the same default configuration, as follows. Furthermore, by the
  condition of Operating System installation, the computer may not be booted due
  to the setting change.

  If your computer runs satisfactorily now, you have no need to change the OS
  Optimized Defaults option. If you need to change the setting, consider well
  the effect of the setting change.

  Affected Setup menu items :
  "OS Optimized Defaults" setting          [Disabled] case      [Enabled] case
  - Security
    - UEFI BIOS Update Option
      - Secure RollBack Prevention         [Disabled]           [Enabled]
    - Secure Boot
      - Secure Boot                        [Disabled]           [Enabled]
  - Startup
    - UEFI/Legacy Boot                     [Both]               [UEFI Only]
    - UEFI/Legacy Boot Priority            [Legacy First]       (Not shown)
    - CSM Support                          [Yes]                [No]

  By the OS to be newly installed, you need to change the OS Optimized Defaults
  option, and load default configuration.

  1. Enter the ThinkPad Setup menu by following steps in [Checking On ThinkPad
     Setup] in the DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED section.
  2. Select Restart, then select OS Optimized Defaults and press Enter.
  3. Select the following setting and press Enter.
       [Enabled]   (for Windows 10/8.1/8 64-bit)
       [Disabled]  (for Windows 8.1/8 32-bit, Windows 7 or Windows XP)
  4. Press the F9 key to load default configuration.
  5. Select Yes.
  6. Press the F10 key to save default configuration and exit.
  7. Select Yes.
     The computer will be restarted automatically.

  (Caution)
  If both the Secure Boot option is Enabled and UEFI Secure Boot in the Main
  menu of ThinkPad Setup is shown as Off, restoring Factory Keys is needed. Do
  the following to restore Factory Keys.

  1. Enter the ThinkPad Setup menu by following steps in [Checking On ThinkPad
     Setup] in the DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED section.
  2. Select Security, then select Secure Boot.
  3. Select Restore Factory Keys, and press Enter.
  4. Select Yes to restore Factory keys.
  5. Press the F10 key to save configuration and exit.
  6. Select Yes.
     The computer will be restarted automatically.

- Lenovo recommends to install the USB 3.0 driver for Windows (Version 1.0.4.225
  or higher) prior to updating the UEFI BIOS. Because the UEFI BIOS requires the
  modification in the USB 3.0 driver to fix USB 3.0 related issues.

- To enable 30 Day standby feature of ThinkVantage Power Manager, the computer
  has to disable waking computer by network adapters and USB devices. Uncheck
  the checkbox next to "Allow this device to wake the computer" in the Power
  Management tab for each device in Device Manager.
